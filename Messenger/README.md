# Messenger

This project was to create a online instant messenger.

I decided to have a log in where the passwords are stored in a sha256 encryption ["Storing Passwords - done right!"](http://www.aspheute.com/english/20040105.asp) on ASPHeute helped to create that.

I didn't know too much about online programming so I took most of the code from ["How to C# chat server programming"](http://csharp.net-informations.com/communications/csharp-chat-server-programming.htm)

To private message someone type .w and then the username without any spaces and then space your message. .wexample test - to private message example "test".

To run the project first have the MySql server running and connected by changing some in the MySQLLib class and have the server running then launch chat applications.
